The virtual queuing app available on the google play store

This app was made for bars and restaurants as a way for them to keep track of their customers if their venue was full so that they did not need to queue. It allows the venue to save a premade message and store customer details such as name, phone number nad how many in the party so that they can be contacted when a table is available

This project uses a variety of different Android and Java features ranging in complexity and I have made the code available for anyone to view in the files
